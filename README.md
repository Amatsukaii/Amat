# 🎯 Amatsukaii's Random Mouse Movement Script  

## 📌 Description  
This script introduces natural and unpredictable mouse movements when a designated mouse button is held down. It aims to simulate **human-like behavior** by applying **randomized** variations in movement and delay.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Randomized Mouse Movement** – Slight variations in X and Y coordinates.  
✔️ **Adjustable Delay** – Randomized timing between movements for a natural feel.  
✔️ **On-Demand Activation** – Triggered by pressing a specific mouse button.  
✔️ **Loop Until Release** – Runs continuously while the button is held down.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
- Press and hold the assigned mouse button (default: **Button 4**).  
- The script will randomly move the cursor in small increments.  
- Release the button to stop the movement.  

## 🎮 Usage  
1. **Install Logitech G Hub** (required for Lua scripting).  
2. Copy and paste the script into a **Logitech Lua profile**.  
3. Change `arg == 4` if you want to assign another mouse button.  
4. Run the script and test the movement!  

## 🔧 Customization  
- Modify `math.random(-3, 3)` for more or less movement.  
- Adjust `math.random(10, 30)` for faster or slower actions.  
- Change the **activation button** in `OnEvent()`.
